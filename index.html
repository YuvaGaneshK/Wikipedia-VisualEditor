<p>Welcome to the portal for<b> VisualEditor </b>, a way of editing Wikipedia being developed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikimedia_Foundation">Wikimedia Foundation (WMF)</a>  that does not require editors to learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext">wiki markup</a> . They previously had to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_editing_with_Wiki_Markup/1">'Source editor' </a> to make edits, but VisualEditor allows people to edit many types of pages without needing to understand simple wikitext. WMF staff hope this encourages more readers to become editors.

    Even after the eventual anticipated full-feature release of VisualEditor, experienced editors may still prefer editing with wikitext because they find it faster and more precise. It will also be needed for editing all discussion pages. Editors who enable VisualEditor will always have the Source editor option available from the toolbar on every page, as the WMF has no plans to remove this.
    
    VisualEditor still has many bugs and missing features. If you encounter an issue, you can report it on the Feedback page, but be aware that that page is not actively monitored by WMF staff. WMF staff prefer that you report bugs via the Phabricator bug tracking website</p>

<h3>About VisualEditor</h3>
<p>VisualEditor is a "visual" way of editing Wikipedia that allows people to contribute without having to learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki#Editing"> wiki markup</a>. This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_rich-text_editor">rich-text editor </a>  was made available as an opt-in release on the English-language Wikipedia in December 2012, in <a href="https://diff.wikimedia.org/2013/04/25/visualeditor-alpha-in-15-languages/">14 other languages in April 2013</a> , and in <a href="https://diff.wikimedia.org/2013/06/06/preparing-for-visualeditor-on-all-wikipedias/">most other languages </a> at the beginning of June 2013. As of April 2015, it was available by default to users of about 76% of the language editions of Wikipedias and as an opt-in <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Beta_Features/About">beta feature</a>   to the rest, along with most non-Wikipedia projects except Wiktionary and Wikisource. On English Wikipedia, it is enabled by default for new users.</p>
<p>As of 2021, the visual editor is used about half as often as the <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:WikiEditor"> 2010 wikitext editor </a> , and about as often as the mobile web editor. It is used about twice as often as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Twinkle">Twinkle</a> .</p>
<p>To learn more about using VisualEditor, please read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:VisualEditor"> guide to VisualEditor </a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:VisualEditor/Keyboard_shortcuts">list of common keyboard shortcuts </a> . Your help with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:VisualEditor#How_to_help_out">many tasks that need to be done</a>  is appreciated. You can also receive regular status updates on your talk page by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:VisualEditor#Newsletter"> signing up for the VisualEditor newsletter.</a></p>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>Current known limitations include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Not available in talk or discussion namespaces </b>  In the English Wikipedia, VisualEditor is not enabled for any talk pages, in the Template or Wikipedia namespaces, and in several of the namespaces that are rarely edited. The "Edit" button for VisualEditor is not available on pages where VisualEditor cannot be used. The <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Talk_pages_project/Replying"> Reply tool</a> has a visual mode based on VisualEditor, as well as a wikitext mode with a live preview.</li>
    <li><b>Template parameters are wikitext, not rich text</b>  VisualEditor lets you edit the parameters of template transclusions, but only as "wikitext" (so "[ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar">[Foo]</a>]" or nested templates like "{{Foo|{{Bar}}}}", not "Foo" or "{{Foo|{{Bar}}}}")</li>
    <li><b>Incomplete editing functionality</b> The content of some complex formatting, including definition lists, will display and can be edited, but editors using VisualEditor cannot modify certain details. Multi-column lists are edited through the complex transclusion dialog, which is difficult. Table editing on Mobile doesn't work properly. Adding features in this area is one of the developers' priorities.</li>
    <li><b>Some browsers not supported </b> VisualEditor works in almost all relatively modern (2012 or newer) versions of Chrome/Chromium, Firefox, Edge, Internet Explorer, Safari, Opera, Midori, Falkon (formerly Qupzilla), SeaMonkey and WebPositive (approximately 95% of all users). VisualEditor will never work in some browsers that do not follow web standards, including Android 2.3 or Internet Explorer 10 or prior. If VisualEditor is not available in your browser, or if you have turned off Javascript, then you will see the buttons for the wikitext editor only.</li>
    <li><b>Footnotes inside templates  </b> Footnotes inside templates (most commonly, infoboxes and { <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Reflist">{reflist}</a>}) are not visible in the "reuse" dialog, causing discrepancies in the numbering of footnotes displayed at the bottom of the main VisualEditor editing window.</li>
    <li> <b>Numeric reference names </b> Currently, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:VisualEditor/Named_references"> VE automatically adds numeric ref names </a> with a colon prefix, i.e., ":0", ":1", ":2", and so on. There has <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Community_Wishlist_Survey_2019/Citations/VisualEditor:_Allow_references_to_be_named">long been interest</a>  in having VE <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:VisualEditor/Named_references">support named references.</a></li>
    <li><b>Unbalanced templates</b>VisualEditor struggles with templates that pass a bit of incomplete code, with markup, to another template or table. These may display oddly or may not be editable if selected in VisualEditor.</li>
    <li><b>Slower</b>Loading longer pages into VisualEditor can take 60 seconds or more for some users.</li>
    <li><b>Cannot edit a single section</b> VisualEditor loads and submits only entire pages. Clicking an edit link for a section will scroll to the appropriate section upon opening. In VisualEditor's model, editing sections would be paradoxically slower than editing the whole page. [Note: Opening an entire page for editing does not increase edit conflicts, which are (roughly) based on editing the same paragraph.]</li>
    <li><b>Cannot upload non-free images</b> At this time, images that are uploaded inside either the wikitext editor or VisualEditor are sent directly to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Commons">Wikimedia Commons</a> , which does not accept non-free images. All images that fall under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Non-free_content"> Wikipedia's non-free content policy</a> must instead be stored on Wikipedia using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:File_upload_wizard"> File Upload Wizard.</a> Commons also runs a filter to reject many images uploaded by editors who have not made many prior edits to Commons, especially for small or low-resolution images.</li>
    <li><b>Unaware of table formatting done by templates</b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Table_cell_templates">Popular table cell templates</a>  (e.g. yes, no, tba, n/a) can cause issues. The reason is that these templates contain a pipe character to separate formatting and text, but VisualEditor isn't aware of this. As a result, table operations which change the table structure, such as merging/splitting cells or inserting/deleting/moving rows or columns, may not work properly.</li>
    <li><b>Data in merged cells is deleted</b>deleted if rows or columns are moved across them. Workaround: Unmerge the affected areas before moving, and merge them again afterwards.
